# Writing Horror

**Stop stalling. Start writing.**

Writing Horror is a distraction-free writing app that uses real consequences to keep you moving forward. Set a word goal, set a time limit, and start typing. If you slow down, the screen turns red and an alarm blares until you pick the pace back up. There is no gentle nudge here -- just relentless pressure to put words on the page.

Built for authors, fiction writers, essayists, journalers, and anyone who knows they *should* be writing but keeps finding reasons not to.

## How It Works

1. **Set your goals.** Choose a word count target (e.g. 500 words) and a time goal (e.g. 30 minutes).
2. **Hit Start.** The app enters a clean, fullscreen writing environment. No menus, no formatting, no distractions.
3. **Write or suffer.** If your typing speed drops below your minimum WPM for more than a few seconds, the screen pulses red and an alarm sounds. It won't stop until you start writing again.
4. **Hit your goal.** When you reach your word count, you get a victory screen with your stats and a button to copy everything you wrote to your clipboard.

That's it. No outlines, no templates, no organizational features. Just a blank page, a word count, and a ticking clock.

## Features

### The Pressure System
- **Minimum WPM threshold** -- Set a floor for your typing speed. Drop below it for more than 3 seconds and the alarm kicks in. The screen flashes red. You'll want to start typing again.
- **Pace tracking** -- The stats bar tells you whether you're ahead, on track, or falling behind relative to finishing your word goal within your time limit.
- **Target WPM** -- Set an aspirational pace. A celebratory sound plays when you hit it, and visual indicators show your velocity in real time.

### No Escape
- **Fullscreen mode** -- Sessions launch in fullscreen by default so you can't glance at other tabs or notifications.
- **No Backspace Mode** -- An optional setting that disables the backspace key entirely. No editing, no second-guessing, no perfectionism. Just forward momentum.
- **No copy/paste** -- You can't paste text in or copy text out until you've hit your word count. You have to earn your words.

### Feedback & Sound
- **Typewriter sounds** -- Optional keystroke audio for tactile feedback.
- **Paragraph chime** -- A sound plays when you start a new paragraph (double Enter), giving a small sense of progress.
- **Custom audio** -- Upload your own sounds for the alert, typewriter, paragraph chime, and target WPM notification. Make it as motivating or terrifying as you want.

### Tracking
- **Session history** -- Every session is saved with word count, duration, average WPM, and whether you hit your goals. See your writing habits over time.
- **Live stats bar** -- During a session, see your current word count, elapsed time, and live WPM at a glance.
- **Velocity arc & rhythm visualizations** -- Real-time visual displays of your writing speed and consistency sit quietly in the corners of your screen.

### After You Finish
- **Copy to clipboard** -- One click copies everything you wrote so you can paste it into your manuscript, Google Doc, Scrivener project, or wherever your real work lives.
- **Session summary** -- See your final word count, time taken, and average WPM.

## Who This Is For

- **Writers who procrastinate.** If you have a novel, essay, blog post, or script that you keep putting off, this app exists to make "not writing" more uncomfortable than writing.
- **NaNoWriMo participants.** Need to hit 1,667 words a day? Set the goal, set the timer, and let the pressure do the rest.
- **Morning pages / journaling practitioners.** If your practice is about volume and consistency rather than polish, Writing Horror keeps you moving.
- **Anyone who edits too early.** No Backspace Mode forces you to write a messy first draft instead of endlessly polishing your opening paragraph.

## Philosophy

Most writing apps try to make writing *pleasant*. Writing Horror takes the opposite approach: it makes *not writing* unpleasant. The idea is simple -- if you sit down and commit to a session, the app won't let you zone out, switch tabs, or stare at the cursor. You either write or you deal with the alarm.

This isn't for every writing session. It's for the sessions where you need to get words out and nothing else has worked.
